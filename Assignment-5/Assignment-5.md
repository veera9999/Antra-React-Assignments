# Interview Questions:

## How do you decide when to split a component into subcomponents?

It is general practice to split a component into subcomponents when it becomes too large, complex, or contains logically distinct parts that can be reused or tested independently. This makes the code readable, well structured and easy to debug.

## What is the difference between state and props?

State is a built-in React object that stores property values that belong to a component. State is used to keep track of changes within a component and managed within the component and can change over time.
Props are read-only attributes and immutable within the component that are passed from a parent component to a child component. Props allow parent components to pass data and event handlers down to child components.
